# Overview
They come in different shapes and sizes but they all share something in common : they are made of 1 to 5 candlesticks<br>

When these types of candlesticks appear on a chart, they can signal potential market reversals.<br>

They can be a hint for :
- **Reversal:** it predicts price will reverse and move in the opposite direction
- **Continuation:** it predicts price will continue its move in the same direction

# Long Line Pattern
- The Long Line candlestick pattern is a 1-bar pattern.
- It simply consists of a long body candle.
- It can be bearish or bullish.

The long line candles are the candles with a very long real body. The long line candle suggests that there is a very huge difference between the opening and closing prices of the assets. That also means that prices greatly increased or decreased during the trading session. If the long line candle is very long and it also has an opposite color to the preceding candles, it indicates a reversal of the current trend in the market.

<center><img src="assets/pattern11.webp"></img></center>

## The Bearish stalled candlestick pattern
The stalled pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that appears during an uptrend and predicts the upcoming reversal of the bullish trend in the market. 
### **How to identify the bearish stalled candlestick pattern?**
- The first candle is a bullish candle that has a long body. 
- The second candle is also a bullish one that continues to increase but is shorter than the previous candle. 
- The third candle is the smallest of all but it also continues but cannot exceed the high of the prior candle. 
- Each candle must open and close higher than the previous candle.
- The third candle must open near the close of the second candle and it must have a long upper wick.

### **What does the bearish pattern tell traders?**
The appearance of the first big bullish candle indicates the presence and strength of the current bullish trend in the market. The next two candles are much shorter and the last one is the smallest. The decreasing size of the bullish candles indicates that the bulls are losing momentum and bears are getting control of the market. It also indicates that the losing positive momentum creates a resistance that the price is struggling to break

## The Bullish stalled candlestick pattern 
The bullish stalled pattern is a bullish reversal pattern that appears during a downtrend in the market. It predicts the upcoming bullish reversal of the trend. However, the bullish stalled pattern is a very rare pattern as compared to the bearish stalled pattern

### **How to identify the bullish stalled candlestick pattern?**
- The first candle must be a bearish candle with a long real body.
- The second candle is also a bearish one with a real body smaller in size than the prior candle. The second candle must also open close to the prior day’s close.
- The third candle is again a bearish candle that is smallest of all. 

### **What does the bullish pattern tell traders?**
The bullish stalled candlestick pattern predicts an upcoming reversal of the trend in the market. The appearance of the first candle indicates the strength and control of the bears. The subsequent two candles are smaller in size indicating that the bears are losing control. 

# Modified Hikkake Candlestick Pattern
- The modified Hikkake candlestick pattern is the more specific and upgraded version of the basic Hikkake pattern.
- The difference with the normal pattern is that the “context bar” is used prior to the inside price bar.
- It consists of a context bar, an inside bar, a fake move, followed by a move above or below the inside bar.

The modified Hikkake candlestick pattern is the more specific and upgraded version of the basic Hikkake pattern. The Hikkake pattern is a situation that comes during the process of technical analysis. The basic Hikkake pattern indicates a reversal or continuation of the trend. It has two bars, an inside bar and the next day’s follow up bar. On the other hand, the modified Hikkake candlestick pattern uses three bars. A context bar is the third bar of the modified Hikkake pattern. The modified Hikkake is also a limited one that only tells traders about reversals but stays silent about the continuation of the trend.<br>

<center><img src="assets/pattern12.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the modified Hikkake candlestick pattern?**
The modified Hikkake candlestick pattern looks at the context bar before the inside bar. The positioning of the bars tells traders whether it is a bullish modified Hikkake or bearish modified Hikkake. For a bullish modified Hikkake to form, the context bar should close near the bottom of its range. It also should have a smaller range in comparison to the preceding bar. A bullish pattern here makes sense only if there is a bearish trend that traders want to reverse. That is the reason that the context bar should close near the top of its range and it will be the start of a bullish modified Hikkake.<br>

On the other hand, for a bearish modified Hikkake to form, the context bar should close near the top of its range. It also should have a smaller range in comparison to the preceding bar. The bearish trend here makes sense only if there is a bullish trend that traders want to reverse. Therefore, the context bar should close near the bottom of its range that will be the start of the bearish modified Hikkake. 

### **What does the pattern tell traders?**
The modified Hikkake pattern tells traders about the upcoming reversal of the prevailing trend in the market. Moreover, it also allows traders to devise different trading strategies to maximize their profits such as placing a buy or sell, a short entry, stop-loss, etc. The higher high and higher low of the next price bars after the inside bar suggest to place a short entry or sell just below the low of the inside day.

# Shot Line Candlestick Patter
- The Short Line candlestick pattern is a 1-bar very simple to understand pattern.
- It simply consists in a candle with a short body.
- There are various kind of specific variations of the short line pattern (doji, hammer, hanging man, shooting star).

<center><img src="assets/pattern17.webp"></img></center>

The short line candles have a short real body and an upper and lower shadow (The upper and lower shadow, that represent the high and low of a trading session, is not important in a short line candlestick pattern). It appears when there is a slight difference between the opening prices and closing prices of financial assets during a trading session. A short line may have a wide range of highs and lows but the open and close range will always be a narrow one. 

### **What does the short line candlestick pattern tell traders?**
Candlestick charts serve technical analysts and traders in multiple ways. They are fantastic visual guides to assess positive or negative market sentiment at a glance. Similarly, the short line candle is also extremely helpful. Generally, short lines indicate market consolidation with little or no movements in prices during a given period of time. However, short line candles may have different meanings depending on their position on the price charts. For example, a short line candle with a lower tail and without upper wick represents a bullish reversal pattern. It blows the whistle of an upcoming reversal of the trend in the market. On the other hand, short line candles forming a series suggest:
- indecisiveness of the traders
- low volatility in the market
- and also provide traders with clues about the direction of the future prices. 

# High Wave Candlestick Pattern
- High wave is a 1-bar candlestick pattern that has very long upper and lower shadows and a small real body.
- It shows indecision in the market.

<center><img src="assets/pattern18.webp"></img></center>

The high wave is a special kind of spinning top basic candlestick that has one or two long shadows. The open and close prices are not the same. They are slightly different from each other. Here, the color of the body doesn’t matter. The pattern is similar to the long-legged Doji.

### **What market dynamics the pattern shows?**
The idea of this pattern is that, throughout the given period, the bulls and the bears both tried to move the market. However, neither was able to hold onto their gains by the end.<br>

Like a spinning top, a high wave pattern has a small real body. The variation is that a spinning top has small upper and lower wicks. A high wave candlestick has relatively long upper and lower wicks, showing more volatility.<br>

High wave candlesticks show a stock that has indecision. The stock market is a battle between the bears and the bulls. Due to this, candlesticks like the high waves tell a story.<br>

- Take a long position when price breaks higher than the high of the candlestick
- Use a candlestick close below the low as a stop level
- Take a short at the break of the low and use a candlestick close above high as a stop

# Stock Sandwich Cnadlestick Pattern
- A stick sandwich is a 3-bar pattern.
- The closing prices of the two candlesticks that surround the opposite colored candlestick have to be the same.

<center><img src="assets/pattern19.webp"></img></center>

## Bearish Stick Sandwich
The bearish stick sandwich is rare. The first pattern to form is a long white (or green) candlestick that ends close to its high. The second candlestick to form will be a black (or red) candlestick that gaps down from the initial close. It closes lower than the open of the previous day.<br>

The third candlestick will be a white (or green) candlestick that covers the second candlestick. It will have the same closing price as the first candlestick. Traders need to wait for the low of the third candlestick to break before taking any short positions.

<center><img src="assets/pattern20.webp"></img></center>

Bearish stick sandwich patterns can form with one or more candlesticks. Most of them need bearish confirmations. The real reversal shows that selling pressure overshadowed the buying pressure for one or more days. However, it is not clear whether or not sustained selling or lack of buyers will continue to drive prices lower.<br>

Without confirmation, a lot of patterns would be neutral and barely show potential resistance levels. Bearish confirmation indicates more downside follow-through, like a gap down, long black candlestick, or high volume decrease. Since patterns are short-term and effective for 1-2 weeks, bearish confirmation should happen within 1-3 days.<br>

## Bullish Stick Sandwich
This candlestick pattern has two black bodies with a white body between them. That is why it resembles a sandwich. The closing of both black candlesticks at the same level indicates that a support price has formed.

<center><img src="assets/pattern21.webp"></img></center>

- The market has a prevailing downtrend
- A black candlestick appears on the first day
- A white body that trades above the close of the previous black body follows
- The third day is a black day with a close same as the first day

### **How to identify the Stick Sandwich candlestick pattern?**
- First, there have to be three candles in a row.
- Second, the middle candle has to be the opposite color of the candles on either side of it. A bearish sandwich will be green-red-green and a bullish sandwich have a red-green-red color.
- Third, the candles on each side will have bigger trading ranges. This will make them longer than the candle in the middle.
- Fourth, the middle candle will be shorter. The candles on each side of it will engulf it.
- Lastly, the bullish stick sandwich has to form during a downtrend while the bearish stick sandwich has to form during an uptrend.

### **What does the Stick Sandwich candlestick pattern tell traders?**
Just like a bar chart, a daily candlestick indicates the market’s open, high, low, and close price for the day. The candlestick has a wide part, which is the real body. This real body shows the price range between the open and close of the trading of that day.<br>

When the real body is black, it indicates the close was lower than the open. If the real body is empty, it indicates the close was higher than the open.<br>

Even though detecting a stick sandwich pattern is not very hard, traders have to be careful to take note of the colors. Basic criteria include accounting for the color of candlesticks on both sides. It also includes the color of the candlestick sandwiched in the middle.<br>

The rationale behind this candlestick approach is that when the market is testing new lows, it will make a red day. The next day will unexpectedly open higher and will trend higher all day, closing at or close to its high.<br>

# On-neck Candlestick Pattern
- The on-neck candlestick pattern is a 2-bar continuation pattern.
- Closing prices of the second candle is nearly the same than first candle high/low forming a horizontal neckline.

<center><img src="assets/pattern29.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the on-neck candlestick pattern?**
- The on-neck pattern is a bearish continuation pattern, therefore, there must be a downtrend in the market.
- The first candle must be a long black candle.
- The second candle must be a small white candle.
- The close of the second candle should match the low of the previous candle. It must not rise beyond the low price of the first candle.

### **What does the on-neck candlestick pattern tell traders?**
The on-neck candlestick pattern is a bearish continuation pattern that predicts the continuation of the current downtrend in the market. The appearance of the first bearish candle indicates the bearish sentiment in the market. The market is in complete control of the bears. In such circumstances, the bulls try to turn the tables expecting that the market will reverse. During the second day, the bulls try to push prices high with great buying pressure. However, the second day’s bullish candle fails to close above the first bearish candle despite the best efforts of the bulls. It opens and closes below the first candle. All this indicates the continuation of the current downtrend.

# In-neck Candlestack Pattern
- The in-neck candlestick pattern is a 2-bar continuation pattern.
- Closing prices of both candles are the same or nearly the same forming a horizontal neckline.

<center><img src="assets/pattern40.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the in-neck candlestick pattern?**
- First of all, it is important that a downtrend must be there for the in-neck candlestick to form.
- The first candle must be a long bearish candlestick.
- The second candle must be a white candle.
- The second candle must open below the previous candle and must close at or slightly above the close of the prior day.

### **What does the in-neck candlestick pattern tell traders?**
The in-neck candlestick pattern tells traders about the possibility of the continuation of the current trend in the market. If the study thoroughly, it also shed light on the overall behavior of the market in which it appears. The appearance of the first bearish candle indicates the strength of the bears in the market. The second candle is a bullish one that shows that bulls are attempting a rally to turn the tables. However, the second candle fails to close above the close of the bearish candle.<br>

Theoretically, the appearance of the in-neck pattern predicts the continuation of the current downtrend in the market because bulls simply cannot overwhelm the bears. It is the specialty of the in-neck pattern that it can predict the continuation despite the bull’s best efforts to push the market up by putting considerable buying pressure. The market goes on its own way after the selling by the bulls who once take a long position hoping for a short pullback. Hence, the current downtrend in the market continues.<br>

### **What does the bullish pattern tell traders?**
The bullish counterattack candlestick predicts that the reversal of the current downtrend in the market is imminent. The appearance of the first black candle with a long real body indicates that the downtrend is continuing in the market. The close of the first candle well below the open boosts the morale of the bears at the expense of bulls’ confidence. The second candle opens and creates a gap below the previous session’s close. However, the opening of the second candle also indicates that selling pressure and the overall downtrend is losing and the bullish reversal is near. The candles of the third or fourth day provide confirmation of the trend reversal. 

## The bearish counterattack candlestick pattern

### **What does the bearish pattern tell traders?**
The bearish counterattack pattern predicts the reversal of the current trend. The appearance of the first bullish candle indicates that the uptrend is continuing. The second candle’s close well above the open further confirms the uptrend. The control of the bulls is also indicated by the second candle that creates an up gap from the close of the first candle. However, the opening of the first candle causes the decline of demand allowing the bears to further pull the prices low. Hence, it becomes clear that the uptrend will reverse in favor of the downtrend after the formation of the bearish counterattack candlestick.

### **What does the bullish pattern tell traders?**
The appearance of the first long black candle indicates the presence of a downtrend in the market. The next three small bearish candles suggest that the bears are losing control and bearish price swing is losing strength. The appearance of the last candlestick shows that bulls have the power to push through prior bearish price gains. Hence, the traders hope that the bulls will maintain their power in the next trading session and the trend will eventually change from bearish to bullish. However, traders should wait for confirmation provided by the candlestick appearing in the next trading session.

- The fifth candle must be a long black candle. 

### **What does the bearish pattern tell traders?**
The appearance of the first white indicates the presence of the current bullish in the trend that is further confirmed by the upward gap between the first two candles. The next three candles are small bullish candles suggesting that the bulls are losing control of the market. The appearance of the fifth candle shows that the bears have taken control of the market. The fifth candle closes below the prior three candles, however, the gap between the first and second candles is not filled by the fifth candle. At this stage, traders hope that the bears will continue to dominate the market in the next trading session and hence, the current uptrend in the market will reverse to a bearish downtrend. However, the bearish breakaway pattern requires a confirmation provided by the candles appearing in the next few days.

As we have discussed earlier that the ladder bottom is a bullish pattern and the prevailing trend in the market is a bearish one. Hence, we can analyze the market and deduce that selling pressure is stronger than the buying pressure and bears are dominating the market. The first three long black candles indicate exactly the same.<br>

However, the appearance of the fourth candle helps to predict an upcoming change in the market. Although the market still closes lower than the opening level but bulls attempt to take control back also becomes clear. Here, the upper long wick of the fourth candle shows exactly the same. The appearance of the fifth candle makes it certain that a change towards an uptrend is about to happen.<br>

The ladder bottom candlestick pattern also tells traders to exit short positions or place their stop-loss levels. However, going long requires confirmation of the bullish reversal. Technical analysts and expert traders always advise using the bottom ladder in combination with other technical analysis tools to predict the bullish reversals and for successful trading.<br>

### **What does the pattern tell traders?**
The advance block candlestick pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that indicates the transition from bullish enthusiasm to a bearish warning. However, the formation of the advance block pattern does not immediately signal a trend reversal, rather it reflects the weakening of the bullish trend. The wicks on the second and third candles help to identify it. Moreover, the advance block pattern is best at forecasting a reversal pattern during upward moves that are of temporary nature and pullbacks during larger-scale downward trends.<br>

The advance block pattern illustrates that the bullish candlesticks are getting shorter even though the market is making new highs. The upper wicks also indicate that the bulls are trying to push the prices high but during the trading session, bears eventually get success to decrease prices down off the highs. All this tussle between the bears and bulls make bulls to settle on the lower gains.<br>

 It also opens the door for selling long positions but short positions are not yet traded. However, the trading strategies are only successful after the confirmation. The confirmation is provided by the candle of the fourth day. If the fourth day’s candle is a black candle with a downtrend gap or a lower closing prices.<br>

he unique three river bottom candlestick pattern is really a unique pattern. It generally is a bullish reversal pattern that predicts an upcoming reversal of the trend. However, testing has also proved that it is not 100% a reversal pattern, and price may go in either direction.<br>

The appearance of the first long black candle indicates that the market is in complete control of the bears and the market hits the extremely low. The formation of the second hammer candle shows that bulls are trying to take back control of the market. The third candle opens higher than the previous low and has a small white body that illustrates that there are strong chances of market stability and an uptrend. All these hints point towards a bullish reversal in the market. However, there are also chances of bearish continuation. Therefore, it is always a wise decision to wait for the confirmation provided by the fourth candle appearing after the unique three river bottom pattern.<br>

If the prices move higher after the confirmation, traders can go for a long position and set a stop-loss below the second candle’s low.

Now, traders should go for a short position and place stop-loss above the high of the second candle.<br>

During the downtrend, the overall market sentiment is bearish that results in the creation of the first large bearish candle.

- The second candlestick must also have a closing price equal or extremely close to the opening price of the first day.
- Both of the candles must be without lower shadows or wicks.

### **What does the pattern tell traders?**
The matching low candlestick pattern is an effective bearish reversal pattern that conveys multiple pieces of information to the traders. The appearance of the first long black candle suggests that the already strong downtrend is likely to continue. At this stage, traders can clearly see that bulls are successful at opening the price higher than the previous day’s closing price. This raises concerns for the short-seekers who start to cover immediately.<br>

However, the bears have still a strong hold on the market and are able to close the price at the low of the day. Yet, this closing price is similar or extremely close to the closing price of the previous day. The appearance of the second small candle suggests that bears are losing control over the market. It’s visible because they could not close below the close of the previous day. This situation indicates that this is a support level for a bullish reversal. Bulls are likely to capitalize on the support level and may attempt a rally to create a new uptrend.<br> 

Moreover, this support level is important because traders may look for a rebound in prices after the appearance of the matching low pattern using close of the previous day as a support level. They may also look for a stop-loss point for this position. For example, after the confirmation, they can initiate a move by placing a stop-loss below the low of the first and second candles. The confirmation is provided by a third candle moving above the high of the first or second candle. Technical analysts and experts suggest waiting for the confirmation before initiating a trade to reduce the risk. If the prices move higher after the appearance of the matching low pattern, it is a confirmation and traders should look to enter a long position.<br>

### **What does the upside gap two crows candlestick pattern tell traders?**
Market understanding is important for successful trading. Traders can improve their market understanding by watch and analyzing the price data and movements in the market. The chart patterns are the most fundamental tools for this purpose. The upside gap two crows pattern is a fascinating chart pattern that also has the potential to clearly portray the picture of the market in front of the traders and technical analysts. During a bullish trend, there is a lot of buying pressure that continues to push prices higher. This is the reason that the first bullish candle of the upside gap two crows pattern forms. The market again opens with a positive gap followed by the finishing of the last candle in the negative territory. This indicates that buying pressure from the bulls has lost control of the selling pressure exerted by the bears. This is the beginning of a downtrend.<br>

The upside gap two crows candlestick pattern also generates sell signals in the overall trading strategy. Moreover, it also tells about mass psychology. Successive gap ups form during an uptrend or within the bounce of a downtrend. Those successive gap ups close down to force the formation of a black candle that suggests the bulls are losing control and the bears are now in power. Although the upside gap two crows pattern is certainly a foreboding pattern, it is difficult to correctly identify the two crows. However, a confirmation is also required after successfully spotting of the crows. That is the reason that it is always important to use the upside gap two crows pattern in conjunction with other technical analysis tools.

### **What does the down-gap side by side white lines pattern tell traders?**
The down-gap side by side white lines candlestick pattern conveys multiple things to the traders. During the downtrend, a black candle appears that indicates the continuation of the downtrend. It suggests that the market is in complete control of the bears. The decline in prices is extremely dramatic that it makes a gap down before the start of the second day’s trading session. However, in the next trading session, the bears lose control and the bulls take charge of the market. The price jumps up, and white candlestick forms. On the third day, the prices open at the same level as it did on the previous day. Again, the bulls continue the effort to increase the prices. The two white candles appearing side by side are similar on the surface but they actually tell traders about this moment of discord. It shows that nothing changed during the two days.<br>

Despite the brilliant efforts of the bulls, the down-gap side by side white lines pattern indicates a continuation of the downtrend. The reason is that the bulls do not have enough power to overwhelm the bears and their efforts for the rally aren’t just enough. The signal is generally considered more powerful when the length of the second and third similar candles is longer.<br> 

The down-gap side by side white lines pattern is a strong indicator with a very clear message although it appears very rarely. However, trusting a single candlestick pattern is always risky. The traders must wait for the formation of a black candle and a downward gap before initiating a trade.<br>

### **What does the up-gap side by side white lines candlestick pattern tell traders?**

They all signal different information about the markets that can be used to increase the odds of getting maximum profits from financial trading. The up-gap side by side white lines candlestick pattern is also another continuation pattern that tells readers about what actually is happening in the market.<br>

As the up-gap side by side white lines pattern appears during an uptrend, the overall market sentiment is a bullish one. All the market participants firmly believe that the market will continue to rise. Hence, the first bullish candle of the up-gap side by side white lines pattern indicates exactly the same idea.

However, at this point, all the market participants think that market might not be able to continue the uptrend, and eventually, sell orders begin to increase.<br>

However, the bullish sentiment remains intact and does not yield to the bearish efforts. A great number of bulls still consider the market attractive and they continue to buy. As a result of this bullish response, the market manages to go up and reach around the close of the previous day. As the bullish respond with the full force and again take full control of the market. This indicates that the uptrend will continue. Hence, the up-gap side by side white lines pattern is a very powerful bullish continuation pattern.

The ladder bottom pattern does the same. It indicates that currently, traders have a positive outlook because of the bullish trend in the market. They continue to buy and keep the momentum going. The first three candles of the ladder top form in such circumstances. However, the appearance of the fifth candles indicates that the bullish sentiment has started to fade. Buyers still continue to buy in response to the new selling wave and keep the market close higher for the fourth candle as well. The fifth candle is the last whistle that predicts an upcoming bearish reversal.<br>

The ladder top pattern also helps to devise some trading strategies as well. Traders can go short when the volume of each of the first four candles is lower than the volume of the previous bar. They can exit the trade after the appearance of all five bars. Moreover, the appearance of the fifth bar also signals to sell. It’s because it ends with an uptrend and starts a bearish trend that is likely to continue. Furthermore, technical analysts and experts always advise not using the ladder top pattern also. It should be used in conjunction with other indicators and patterns for solid confirmation of a bearish reversal.<br>

- The third is again long and black opening near or at the same closing level of the second candle.

- All the candles have a very small shadow or without a shadow at all.

### **What does the pattern tell traders?**
The identical three crows candlestick pattern is a bearish reversal pattern. It indicates an upcoming reversal of the trend from bullish to bearish. The pattern also reveals the psychology that leads to the formation of the identical three crows. It illustrates that the bulls have complete control over the market and are continuously trying to push prices high. But, once the pattern ends, anything is possible. Generally, prices make lower lows for a short period of time, then bounce up, round over, and eventually go down again.<br>

What does actually happen? It happens that the bulls start the trading session with the prices slightly higher than the closing of the previous session. But the entry of the bears put pressure and prices begin to decrease. Eventually the closing levels are low as a result of bears’ pressure. Volume is also another factor that helps to get an insight into the market. For example, relatively low volume during the uptrend and the high volume of identical three crows during the session suggest that a small group of bulls established the uptrend but a large group of bears reversed the trend.<br>

That is how the chart patterns help to identify different things and also to get an insight into the market sentiment. However, technical analysts and expert traders suggest using the identical three crows candlestick pattern in conjunction with other technical analysis tools for a confirmation of a trend reversal in the market.<br>

# Thrusting Pattern
- The Thrusting candlestick pattern is a two-bar pattern.
- The second candle gaps up/down and then retrace to close within the 1st candle’s body.

<center><img src="assets/pattern133.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the Thrusting candlestick pattern?**

- The second day’s candle is a short white candle that opens below the low of the previous day. 
- The second candle must also close in the body of the first candle without exceeding its midpoint. 

### **What does the pattern tell traders?**
The thrusting candlestick pattern conveys multiple pieces of information to the interested parties. It is generally considered a reliable pattern but only after the confirmation. During a strong downtrend, a long bearish candle appears that indicates the bearish sentiment in the market. It is generally a concern for the bulls who try to intervene in the proceedings to push the prices higher. As a result of the new buying pressure exerted by the bulls gives rise to the second candle that opens below the low of the previous day. However, the second candle fails to break out above the midpoint of the first candle. It suggests that bulls are not just strong enough to turn the tables and the current downtrend in the market is likely to continue.<br>

The thrusting pattern also offers different trading plans to increase the odds of maximizing profits. When the candle appearing after the candle moves above the high of the first candle, it is a signal to enter a long position. If the prices move below the low of the second candle, it signals to enter a short trade. If the trend reverses after the thrusting pattern, traders should place stop-loss below the low of the pattern. The continuation of the downtrend suggests to place a stop-loss above the high of the thrusting candlestick pattern.<br>

However, it is important to note that the thrusting candlestick pattern is a flip coin that depends on whether the prices will move higher or lower. Therefore, it must be used for trading or technical analysis with full care before acting upon the thrusting pattern.<br>

Moreover, continuation price candles must agree with the trend direction indicated by the closing marubozu pattern. This pattern forms only when all these conditions are met. 

### **What does this pattern tell traders?**
The closing marubozu candlestick pattern is popular for powerful signals that show that the market trend is in one direction. In both of the bullish or bearish marubozu patterns, either of the sides remains so strong that one completely overpowers the other one. The bullish closing marubozu pattern suggests that the buyers were in complete control of the market. They maintained the buying pressure throughout the trading session.<br>

If the candle appears near the support or resistance levels, the closing marubozu pattern becomes more interesting. It’s because it can open on one side and close on the other further adding to the current trend. Moreover, the closing marubozu can appear anywhere on the trading charts. Though it is the most powerful when they follow a period marked by sideways trading activity. The trading strategies will differ based on the type of closing marubozu pattern. Traders can place stop-loss at high or low of the candle.<br>

Although the marubozu is a very strong pattern but it may give false signals such as signals associated with an extremely small or large candlestick. The small stick exhibits a reduced trading activity and the large one shows extensive trading. Both of these candlesticks may generate false signals. Moreover, it is necessary to look for further confirmation. Entering a trade on the basis of the closing marubozu pattern alone is not adviced.<br>

# Upside Gap Three Methods Pattern
- The upside gap three methods candlestick pattern is a 3-bar bearish continuation pattern.
- It has 2 green candles and a red one.
- The second candle gaps above the first one.

<center><img src="assets/pattern147.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify this candlestick pattern?**
- The prevalent trend in the market must be an uptrend. 
- The first candle must be white, long, and bullish.
- The second candle must also be white, long, and bullish creating an upside gap between itself and the first candle. 
- The third candle must be a bearish one covering the gap between the first and the third candle. 

### **What does the pattern tell traders?** 
The upside gap three methods candlestick pattern is an important pattern even though it has medium reliability. It is a continuation pattern, therefore, it indicates that the bullish trend will continue after a pause. It also shed light on the psychology of the masses involved in trading during the period of its formation.<br>

The upside gap three methods pattern is characterized by a gap that occurs when the market is moving upward. The third candle must fill the gap. The fact that the gap is filled immediately leads traders to believe that the stalemate was temporary and resulting pullback is a profit-taking opportunity.<br> 

Moreover, the appearance of the first bullish candle indicates that the uptrend is continuing with close well above the open creating a long-range real body. This boosts the confidence of the bulls and raises concerns for the bears. The appearance of the second candle justifies the confidence of the bulls at the expense of some serious concerns of the bears. The second candle creates a gap up and resulting buying pressure pushes the prices to new highs. Eventually, profit-taking activities let the third candle fill the gap. Again, after the completion of the upside gap three methods candlestick pattern, the bulls assume that the bullish trend will continue.<br> 

Like all the rest of the candlestick patterns, the upside gap three methods candlestick pattern is also highly useful for extracting valuable information about the market. However, it is imperative to learn about the patterns and identify them correctly to maximize the odds of successful trading.<br>

# Two Crows Pattern
- The Two Crows candlestick pattern is a three-line bearish reversal pattern.
- How to identify the pattern:
    - The market must be in an uptrend. 
    - The first candle must be a long white candle. 
    - The second candle is a short black candle that starts with an upwards gap.
    - The third candle must close the gap between the first two candles and it opens inside the body of the previous candle and closes inside the first candle.

<center><img src="assets/pattern148.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify this candlestick pattern?**
- The market must be in an uptrend. 
- The first candle must be a long white candle. 
- The second candle is a short black candle that starts with an upwards gap.
- The third candle must close the gap between the first two candles and it opens inside the body of the previous candle and closes inside the first candle.

### **What does the Two Crows candlestick pattern tell traders?**
The two crows candlestick pattern is a 3-days pattern that is only a bearish reversal pattern. The first white candle increases the bullishness of the already present uptrend. The gap is up on the next day. Prices begin to fall and the small black candle forms. However, the prices fail to close below the close of the previous day. The third candle opens above or at the close level of the second day’s close but it continues to decline and closes well inside the body of the second candle. The third candle fills the gap and signals the deterioration of the bullish trend.<br>

The appearance of a relatively small black candle signals a loss of upward momentum. Then a large black candle follows the small candle of the previous day that confirms the change in momentum. It indicates that bulls are losing control and buying pressure has begun to fade. Being a bearish trend reversal pattern, the two crows pattern is also popular for generating reliable sell signals. However, it is important to note that the two crows bearish pattern requires confirmation. The confirmation is provided by the following candle breaking a trend line or the closest support area that the first line generally creates. If the confirmation is not confirmed, it is nothing more than a pause during an uptrend. The two crows candlestick pattern is a “trade with the trend” pattern that makes it perform well for the technical analysts and traders.<br>

# Island Reversal Pattern
- An Island Reversal Pattern appears when two different gaps create an isolated cluster of price.
- It usually gives traders a reversal biais.

<center><img src="assets/pattern155.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the Island Reversal candlestick pattern?**
The identification of the Island Reversal candlestick pattern is quite easy. As we have discussed earlier that the Island Reversal patterns can be both, bullish and bearish. It is important to know about the identification of both of the reversal patterns. 

#### **Identification of the bullish Island Reversal**<br>
It is easy to guess that the bullish Island Reversal pattern appears during a bearish trend to turn it around. The first thing to note is the presence of a downtrend in the market. There must be a negative gap that signals the start of a reversal. After the identification of the gap, it is all about noticing the behavior of the market whether it is continuing downward movement or is it consolidating. The gap zone remains intact and the price should recede after an upward movement. After trading below the gap for some time and the formation of price action, it generates a positive gap. It usually appears at or very close to the price level where the first gap was formed. 

#### **Identification of the bearish Island Reversal**
Again it is quite easy to predict that a bearish pattern appears during a bullish trend. For a bearish Island Reversal, the market should be in an uptrend and there should be a significant positive gap. It is important to notice whether the market is continuing upward movement or is it consolidating without filling the gap. It is crucial that the gap zone doesn’t fill immediately. This will give rise to a bearish trend occurring around the first gap.<br>

So, as a general rule, the Island Reversal candlestick pattern usually comes into existence after the movement of the market in a certain direction followed by the formation of a gap in the direction of the movement. The gap will be upwards during the upwards movement and it will be downwards during the downwards movement of the market. This advancement will be for a short interval and the formation of a gap in the opposite direction will be imminent. 

### **Important features of the Island Reversal candlestick pattern**
- The occurrence of the Island Reversal pattern is very rare
- An Island Reversal can appear at the bottom or at the top
- Its gap form at almost the same level of price
- It is well known for a really good indication of a primary or intermediate trend reversal
- Its appearance indicates an extreme change in the sentiment among the traders 

# Takuri Pattern
The Takuri candlestick pattern is a single candle bullish reversal pattern. It has a very small body with a much longer lower wick and without an upper wick. This pattern illustrates how a downtrend is opposed by the bulls and the candle eventually closes near its high. The color of the candle doesn’t matter and it can be black or white.<br>

The Takuri candlestick pattern is just like the Hammer candlestick pattern but there is one difference. The length of the lower wick of Hammer cannot be twice bigger than the length of its body. The Takuri’s lower wick must exceed at least three times of its body.<br>

- The Takuri is like the hammer pattern but with a longer bottom shadow.
- It has a small body and a long lower tail.

<center><img src="assets/pattern156.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the Takuri candlestick pattern?**
As we have discussed earlier, the Takuri pattern forms at the bottom of the chart. It is a single line candle with a long lower wick and a small body. You should look for a candle that has a three-times greater lower than the length of the body. It may be white or black because the color of the candle is not important. However, it is imperative to differentiate between a Hammer and the Takuri pattern before trading activity. This is important because of the similarities between these two candlestick patterns. 

### **What does the Takuri candlestick pattern tell traders?**
The Takuri candlestick pattern tells traders about an upcoming price reversal to the upside. It shows how, after a prevalent downtrend, bulls reject the trend. As a result, the prices close near high. The prices must start rising after the appearance of the Takuri candlestick. Traders call it the confirmation. This is also considered as a potential buying signal as the prices begin to rise.

# Spinning Top Patter
The Spinning Top candlestick pattern is a versatile single candle pattern. It is versatile and mysterious because of its formation that can occur at the peak of an uptrend, in the very middle of a trend, or at the bottom of a downtrend.

It is a small candlestick pattern that can be both, a bearish or bullish pattern. This pattern is formed when opening and closing prices are almost similar or very close to each other. It also illustrates that there is indecision among traders in the uptrend, downtrend, or during a trend.

Like most of the other patterns, it also suggests the imminent change in trend. Experts emphasize that the Spinning Top pattern just shows the state of confusion among traders about the direction of the market. Therefore, it should not be taken as a continuation or reversal signal.

- The Spinning Top pattern is a symmetrical candlestick reversal pattern.
- The candle body should be small and both shadows should be about the same size.
- It’s the sign of indecision (as for a doji).

<center><img src="assets/pattern161.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify a Spinning Top candlestick pattern?**
The Spinning Top candlestick pattern is comparatively easy to identify just like the Doji candlestick pattern. It has the same structure and logic as the simple Doji pattern. However, it has a wider candle body which exhibits a significant movement in market prices during the period of the candle. In short, if a candlestick pattern has a wider body with almost equal-sized long wicks at both sides, it is your Spinning Top candlestick pattern.

### **What does the pattern tell traders?**
The Spinning Top candlestick pattern is advantageous for the traders in the sense that it is much stronger in a trending market. Whether it be in an uptrend or a downtrend, it indicates a balance of bullish and bearish forces. It tells traders that the opposite direction of the market has the potential to grow in the market. Hence, it makes the short-term outcome very uncertain.<br>

Again in this pattern, the key is the next candle. The next candle should be the opposite of the current trend in the market. If so is the case, it is important to search for a candle in the same direction. It will confirm that the price action will continue in the same direction. 

### **How to trade the pattern?**
During an uptrend, the Spinning Top candlestick pattern shows a possible reversal because of fewer potential buyers. During a downtrend, it also indicates a price reversal because of fewer sellers in the market. In either case, technical analysts emphasize that traders should wait for a confirmation signal before initiating a trade.<br>

Moreover, it is advised to use derivatives such as spread bets. Derivatives do not allow ownership of the underlying assets but tracking price movements gets easy. This means that it becomes easy for you to trade rising and falling markets after both, bullish Spinning Top candlestick pattern and bearish Spinning Top candlestick pattern.<br>

# Rickshaw Man Pattern
The Rickshaw Man candlestick pattern is very similar to the Long-Legged Doji pattern. A Long-Legged Doji pattern is the one that has a closing and opening price happening at or in the middle of the shadows. The high and low prices are far apart and make very long wicks. When opening and closing are almost similar, it creates a Doji. Hence, the Rickshaw Man pattern appears on the chart as a Doji body with a long candle.<br>

The difference between the Rickshaw Man and the Long-Legged Doji is that a Rickshaw Man pattern has the body near the midpoint of the candle. The Rickshaw Man pattern appears when bears and bulls try and control market prices at different times but during the same period. This creates a long trading range that is exhibited by the long candle of the pattern.<br> 

It must be remembered that the Rickshaw Man only alludes towards indecision in the market. It shows that supply and demand are in a state of equilibrium. Technical experts and analysts consider this pattern not a highly reliable pattern unless used with other technical indicators.<br> 

- The Rickshaw man pattern is a candlestick pattern with long wick and tail and a small body in the middle.
- It shows indecision in the market.

<center><img src="assets/pattern167.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify a Rickshaw Man candlestick pattern?**
It is not that easy to identify the Rickshaw Man pattern because the price trend leading to the pattern is not mandatory. You should look for a single candle line with a small Doji-like body and long wicks at either side of the body. The body of the candle is near the midpoint of the candlestick. You should also look for opening and closing prices that are within the pennies of each other.

### **What does the pattern tell traders?**
The behavior of the Rickshaw Man pattern amounts to indecision. It behaves just like the Doji patterns that show the indecision and state of equilibrium in the market. Similar opening and closing prices illustrate the reason behind the inability of traders to take decisions. When expert traders see the Rickshaw Man pattern, they cannot decide their move. They are compelled to sit on the side-line and wait.

### **How to trade a Rickshaw Man candlestick pattern?**
Technical analysts and experts suggest that the Rickshaw Man candlestick pattern must be used with other technical indicators, chart patterns, or price action analysts to observe a changing trend or continuation. They do not consider this pattern reliable to be used in isolation. Let us try to understand the trading of a Rickshaw Man pattern. For example, during a current uptrend, the prices begin to fall. In this scenario, the Rickshaw Man pattern in conjunction with an oversold stochastic signal that the low of the downtrend is near. When the prices begin to move up, the Rickshaw Man pattern and signals of other indicators are confirmed.

# Piercing Line Pattern
A Piercing line candlestick pattern is a two-day bullish candlestick reversal pattern that appears in a downtrend. It signals a potential short term reversal from downwards to upwards. It consists of two major components, a bullish candle of day 2 and a bearish candle of day 1.<br>

The Piercing pattern depends upon the near high opening prices of day 1 followed by the near low closing prices of day 2. The trading range of the Piercing pattern may vary from an average to a larger size.<br>

The gap down after the first day is also part of this pattern. The gap shows the beginning of the day 2 trading that opens near the low and closes near the high. It is also interesting and very important to note that day 2’s price gap downs are only for the sake of filling gaps. It usually closes into the losses made in the first day’s bearish candlestick. Being a bullish candlestick pattern, Piercing Pattern prompts a trend reversal when the bulls push prices high.<br>

- The Piercing Line candlestick pattern is a 2-bar reversal pattern.
- The pattern has of a bearish candle and then a bullish candle gapping down and taking back at least 50% of the prior candle.

<center><img src="assets/pattern171.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify a Piercing candlestick pattern?**
To identify a Piercing candlestick pattern, all the elements of its formation must be kept in mind. You should look for a pattern with two candlesticks. The second candlestick begins below the low of the bearish candle and closes above the middle of it. Bearish candlestick is usually of a red or any other dark color signifying a downtrend. The second candle is of a lighter or green color that signifies a high closing day. A Piercing candlestick pattern is a kind of special signal whenever it is formed because the reversal of the pattern is highly unexpected. 

### **What does the pattern tell traders?**
The first candlestick pinpoints a bearish trend in the trading market. The second candlestick opening with a bearish gap presents high expectations of bears. However, the second candle closes against the expectations of bears on a strong bullish note. Therefore, a Piercing pattern tells traders of an upcoming change of trend and also signals that bearish traders are now losing control.

### **How to trade a Piercing candlestick pattern?**
Technical analysts and experts use other indicators as well to confirm a buying signal given by a Piercing line candlestick pattern. As a Piercing pattern indicates that bears lose control, as a result, a bullish movement is more likely. The bullish advancement on the second day also confirms that bulls have taken control of the market. This win of the bulls over bears is considered as a buying signal. Although a Piercing pattern signals a trend reversal, experts do not suggest to rely only on it. It is advised and recommended to use further support signals in conjunction with the Piercing candlestick pattern.

# Long-Legged Doji Pattern
Candlestick patterns are becoming more and more popular these days for charting prices. They are easy to detect with their colorful bodies and black wicks and easy to observe the ways and the behavior of the market. One such popular candlestick pattern is the Long-Legged Doji candlestick pattern. As it is obvious from the name, it has a long leg on both sides, upside, and downside. It has a body that is so tiny or almost non-existent. It signals an upcoming reversal of the current trend. Like the other Doji patterns, it also exhibits the uncertainty in the market.<br>

It is important for the traders to realize that Long-Legged Doji candlestick patterns appear during a specific market event. The nature of Long-Legged Doji alludes towards the potential trading opportunities for the traders. Although it looks very similar to other Doji patterns, it has something unique and meaningful, especially whenever and wherever it appears on the price chart.<br>
- The Long-Legged Doji is a 1-bar candlestick pattern.
- It has a small body and long upper and lower shadows.
- It reflects indecision in the market.

<center><img src="assets/pattern176.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the Long-Legged Doji candlestick pattern?**
- A tiny or almost absent body that illustrates that opening and closing prices are the same or almost same with a difference of just a few pennies 
- Opening and closing prices are located right in the middle of the range of the candle 
- Very long wicks

### **What does this pattern tell traders?**
Every candlestick pattern tells a very unique tale about the ways and behaviors of the market. Such information about the market is always crucial for the traders. They use it to forecast upcoming price deviations and Long-Legged Doji candlestick pattern is also significant in this sense.<br>

Like the other Doji candlestick patterns, Long-Legged Doji candlestick pattern tells about the equilibrium in the market. The difference is that it tells about the prices that went far higher and at the same time, about the prices that went to extremely low levels. It also shows that supply and demand are in a state of equilibrium and a fall in price may occur at any moment. 

### **How to trade when you see the Long-Legged Doji candlestick pattern?**
Once you have a Long-Legged Doji on your chart, it is very difficult to just directly trade off it. The reason is, the range of the candle is so vast and it gets difficult to make a decision. If you trade-off in this situation, your stop loss will also be as vast as the range of the candle.<br>

It is crucial to notice that highs and lows of a Long-Legged Doji candlestick pattern actually become resistant and support on the lower timeframe. So why not trade support and resistance? You may also use level and the areas on your chart to establish a bias to set positions to enter the market.<br>

So, in that case, the market came up higher into the domain of resistance, which means the highs of the Long-Legged Doji. This illustrates the rejection of lower prices. On the other hand, if the prices move below the pattern, it is wise to enter a short position. However, it is highly recommended that other factors should also be considered such as your trading strategy, risk management, etc.

# Homing Pigeon Pattern
The Homing Pigeon candlestick pattern is a two-line candlestick pattern. Traditionally, traders consider it a bullish reversal candlestick pattern. However, testing has proved that it may also act as a bearish continuation pattern. This new development proves it to be near random because you won’t be confident about the prediction of breakout direction. However, its overall performance is considered very reliable.<br>

The Homing Pigeon candlestick pattern generally forms in a downtrend and predicts a reversal. Like the other candlestick patterns, subsequent patterns confirm it. Its first and second lines are both black candles. The first candle engulfs the second candle. The first line can be any black candle such as Black Candle, Long Black Candle, etc. but it must be a long line. The second candle can also be any black candle just like the first line but it can be both, a short line or a long line.<br> 

- The Homing Pigeon is a bullish 2-bar reversal candlestick pattern.
- It is composed by 2 red candles, a big one and a smaller one, contained within the first one.

<center><img src="assets/pattern177.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the pattern?**
As we have already discussed that a Homing Pigeon candlestick pattern consists of two candle lines. It appears usually in the downtrend. Therefore, you should look for a two-line candlestick pattern in a downtrend. It should be a long black body on the first day followed by a second black body that is contained in the first body. 

### **What does a Homing Pigeon candlestick pattern tell traders?**
There are many bearish traders and investors on the market who strongly believe that it will continue to fall. When the first candle of the Homing Pigeon candlestick pattern is formed, the same scenario develops. The formation of a long bearish candle confirms the possibility of an upcoming bearish trend. After some quieter buying period, some buying pressure begins to establish itself. Traders assume the reversal of the trend in the market. This assumption causes a gap between the two candlesticks. However, the buying pressure still fails to move the market up, hence making the second candle bearish. 

### **How to trade the pattern?**
In a Homing Pigeon candlestick pattern, a trader should enter a long position. Placing the stop loss below the low of the pattern is a wise move. They can also place the stop loss below the low of the second line as well.<br>

During a downtrend, traders should wait for enough for the prices to decrease after the formation of the Homing Pigeon pattern. Now, they should enter a short position, and placing the stop loss above will be a wise decision.<br> 

However, it must be remembered that the Homing Pigeon pattern does not give a price target. It is possible that a new trend may start after the patter or price may not move at all. Therefore, traders should base price target on a well-defined risk-reward, a well-measured move, or according to a trading strategy and risk management.<br>

# Hanging Man Pattern
As the name suggests, the Hanging Man candlestick pattern is a bearish sign that appears in uptrends. On occasions, it also tells traders about the upcoming price reversal. The experts of the domain suggest that the Hanging Man pattern must be taken as a warning, not just a signal, of potential changes in the prices.<br>

The Hanging Man candlestick pattern has a body that is shorter and flat at the top. It has a longer lower wick (shadow) and a very little or no upper wick at all. The long lower wick exhibits volatility and the wide range of intra-day trading. Its shorter body suggests that opening and closing prices remained close to each other. However, experts claim that the longer lower wick must be longer than the body of the pattern. They also suggest that the body should also be above the intra-day trading range. Only then, it will be a valid Hanging Man pattern.<br> 

- The Hanging Man pattern is a 1-bar candlestick bearish reversal pattern.
- It has a short body and a long lower tail which should be at least twice the size of the body.
- It appears after a bullish advance in price.

<center><img src="assets/pattern181.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the pattern?**
It is comparatively easy to identify Hanging Man. As we have discussed earlier, it has a small body and a long lower shadow. And the shadow, as the name “Hanging Man” suggests, hangs completely below the body. It appears on the uptrend and usually, it breaks a most recent high or it is very close to a recent high. Another important hint is that its top meeting a resistance area. 

### **What does the Hanging Man candlestick pattern tell traders?**
It tells to the traders through visual evidence that the buyers are failing to keep the prices high. It acts as a warning that buyers are losing the battle. Even if buyers are somehow able to keep the prices high, large sell-off continues to drag prices lower. Hence, the Hanging Man candlestick pattern tells the traders about the first phase of selling pressure during an uptrend. However, on many occasions, it can also indicate a warning sign for current long positions. 

### **How to trade when you see the Hanging Man candlestick pattern?**
Traders can take full advantage of the Hanging Man pattern. Once you have the evidence that tells the trend is close to the end, you should look at those levels where you may close your trade. On the contrary, when the uptrend is about to end and there is evidence of a potential reversal, it is the best opportunity to make profits. Moreover, as per your trading strategy, you may also consider incorporating the Hanging Man pattern as a sell signal.

# Hammer Pattern
The Hammer candlestick pattern is a bullish reversal pattern that indicates a potential price reversal to the upside. It appears during the downtrend and signals that the bottom is near. After the appearance of the hammer, the prices start moving up.<br>

Hammer candlestick has a unique shape. It has a lower shadow of at least twice the size of the body. It has a very little body and a very tiny or non-existent upper shadow. The long lower shadow of it illustrates that sellers were able to push the prices lower but buyers will be able to overpower the selling pressure. Hence, the closing prices remain near to opening prices. The formation of Hammer in the downtrend does not mean to automatically place a buying order. It is imperative to have more bullish confirmations before taking any decisions.<br> 

- The Hammer pattern is a 1-bar bullish reversal candlestick pattern.
- It looks like the letter “T” and has a small body and a long lower shadow.

<center><img src="assets/pattern187.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify it?**
- The long lower wick that is at least twice the size of the body
- A tiny body that lies at the upper end of the trading range
- The very small or non-existent upper wick 

### **What does the Hammer pattern tell traders?**
Hammer candlestick pattern tells traders that a reversal in prices is about to happen after the determination of the bottom by the market. It indicates that the selling pressure will be overcome by the bulls and the prices will begin to rise again. However, it is important to notice that Hammer candlestick does not indicate the reversal of downtrend to upwards until the confirmation. 

### **How to trade when you see the pattern?**
Hammer pattern isn’t used in isolation, ever after the confirmation by the hammer. Traders use it for analysis of the trend of the market. It is always the best strategy to trade within the context of the market instead of trading any single candlestick pattern. It is advised by the experts to trade in the direction of the trend. Secondly, trading from an area of value is advantageous. Lastly, it is important for your success to identify an entry trigger to initiate your trading.

### **Difference between the Hammer candlestick pattern and the Hanging Man candlestick pattern**
The Hammer is very similar to the Hanging Man candlestick pattern. Both have similar shapes with a small body, tiny or absent upper wick, and a long lower wick. The only difference between them is the nature of trends in which they appear. If a pattern appears in an upward trend and indicates a bearish reversal, it is Hanging Man. Conversely, if a pattern appears in a downtrend indicating a bullish reversal, it is a Hammer candlestick pattern.

# Doji Candlestick Pattern
Candlestick patterns that have the same opening and closing price are known as “Doji candlestick pattern”. There are four basic types of Doji candles:
1. Four-Price Doji
2. Long-legged Doji
3. Dragonfly Doji 
4. Gravestone Doji

<center><img src="assets/pattern191.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the Doji candlestick pattern?**
A Doji candlestick pattern forms as a direct result of a battle between the bullish and bearish traders. It is formed when the bullish traders drive the prices up while bearish traders try to push prices down. It may also form in the opposite scenario as well. That is when the bearish traders try to push the prices down while the bullish traders drive prices up. As a result of this battle, the market explores uptrend and downtrend but it does not commit to either o the direction. Hence, it reflects an equilibrium state or a state of indecision between buyers and sellers. This upward and downward movement of the prices forms the wicks. The same opening and closing prices form the body, although they remain the same.

### **What does the Doji pattern tell traders?**
Doji candlestick pattern is a clear sign of equilibrium or neutrality. It strongly suggests that neither sellers nor buyers are gaining in this state of indecision. However, some traders believe that Doji indicates an upcoming reversal in prices when it is observed in combination with other candlestick patterns. In our opinion, it may not be the case always. However, the good point is, it is a sign that a prior trend is ending, so there is an indication of getting some profits. 

### **How to trade when you see it?**
Doji candlestick pattern manifests indecision. Therefore, after a long trend, it is the most suitable strategy to exit your position or at least scale back. Similarly, after facing a long downturn, it is reasonable to reduce the size of your position, or exit completely. However, it is advised to look for signals complementing the Doji pattern. Momentum indicators and stochastic oscillators are among the best tools to get assistance from. 

# Doji Start Candlestick Pattern
A Doji Star candlestick pattern is a three-bar pattern. It is considered as a signal of a potential upcoming reversal of the current trend of the market. It is a versatile candlestick pattern that is found in two variants, bullish and bearish. Its variants depend on the trend in which it exists.<br>

In order to understand the Doji Star candlestick pattern, it is important to understand a simple Doji candlestick pattern. Doji candlestick pattern is formed when opening and closing prices are at the same or almost at the same level. The pattern looks like a plus sign or cross.<br> 

- The Doji Star pattern is a 3-bar reversal candlestick pattern.
- It starts with a long candle, gaps to draw a doji and then it reverses with a bigger candle in the opposite direction.

## Bullish Doji Star candlestick pattern
### **How to identify the bullish Doji Star candlestick?**
- Look for a normal red candlestick on the very bottom of the charts on the first day. If confirms the prevalent downtrend and also illustrates that price closed lesser than the opening price. 
- Next, look for a small Doji on the second day showing that there is very minimal or no gap at all between opening and closing prices. 
- Now look for the third candlestick showing a gap up opening. 

### **How to trade the bullish Doji Star pattern?**
You should think about initiating a trade on the long side while keeping a stop loss just to be at the safe side if prices start to move in the opposite direction. You may also try to check 5 minutes and 15 minutes timeframes to analyze this pattern and take your guards accordingly. After the formation of the bullish Doji Star pattern, prices begin to move up. Therefore, if you initiate trade after confirmation of this pattern, there are strong chances that you will be able to gain profit. 

## Bearish Doji Star candlestick pattern
### **How to identify a bearish Doji Star candlestick?**
You should look for a candlestick with a long white line and a Doji that is above that first candle. You should also remember that the shadow of the Doji will not be too long and the shadows of the line do not overlap. Hence, these hints make it easy to identify a bearish Doji Star candlestick pattern.

### **How to trade a bearish Doji Star pattern?**
A bearish Doji Star is a signal that shows the end of an uptrend and start of a bearish reversal leading to decreasing the prices. Therefore, it is a wise move to sell the stock whenever a bearish Doji Star pattern appears.

# Three Start int the South Pattern
- The Three Stars in the South candlestick pattern is a very rare pattern that doesn’t typically precede large price moves.
- The bullish pattern forms with three black or red (down) candles of decreasing size. It usually follows a price decline.
- The bearish pattern forms with three white or green (up) candles of decreasing size. It usually follows a price increase.

<center><img src="assets/pattern198.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the Three Stars in the South pattern?**
- The market has to be in a downtrend
- The first candlestick is black, with a long real body, long lower shadow, and it lacks an upper shadow
- The second candlestick is black with a shorter real body and a low that’s higher than that of the first low candle
- The third candlestick is black with a short real body, without shadows, and a close that is within the second candle’s high-low range

### **Practical advices**
Practically, it is hard to get this pattern on candlestick charts. The reversals can also be relatively muted, which means little upside for traders betting on a rally. This pattern, as well as other candlestick patterns, doesn’t have a profit goal. So, even if they are efficient, and the price rises after the pattern forms, in this case, there is no indication of how far it will increase.<br>

Traders could make use of the pattern as an indication to leave a short position or to enter a long position, although ideally going in on the confirmation bar as the price starts to rise is preferred by traders. Also, traders should look for confirmations by using other chart patterns or technical indicators to support a reversal theory.<br>

For instance, if a stock is trending higher but has recently gone through a pullback, a trader could watch for three stars in the south pattern together with a bullish stochastic crossover in oversold areas. All used together, these pieces of information create a more convincing trade idea, particularly if the three stars in the south is followed by any bullish confirmation candlesticks.<br>

### **What does the Three Stars in the South tell traders?
A strong and consistent downtrend lays the foundation for this candlestick pattern. But a crack shows up in this foundation when the pattern is seen. With each new candle that is formed in the three-candle signal, the downtrend loses strength. The momentum of the bears deteriorates, and the candlesticks get shorter and shorter, reducing the power of the downward movement.<br>

Even though every day ends lower than the previous, the bears are making less progress than they were initially. Every candle covers the subsequent candle. Therefore, traders predict that the prevailing downtrend will change direction and form an uptrend. At any period, the bulls should step-in to raise the price again. Higher prices will soon appear.<br>

When you notice this pattern, you know that a change is on the horizon. As the downtrend reduces, the chance of a reversal increases. Even though this is not a particularly dependable bullish reversal pattern, it proves greatly uncommon. Thus, if you notice it, thank your lucky stars!<br>

Also, confirm by waiting for the price to cross above the middle of the last black body. When you see this, you can confidently say that the bulls have taken control of the reins and an uptrend will occur.<br>

# Belt Hold Pattern
All patterns have a unique tale to tell about market forces that lead to its formation. And traders might benefit by trying to identify what drove the market to where it is now. Knowing exactly why a market carried out a particular move is almost impossible. Having that said, we can get to some probable conclusions. Let’s focus on the Belt Hold candlestick pattern here.<br>

Belt holds are an important area of chart patterns because they show areas where market sentiment may be changing. As the name suggests, the belt hold acts as a support to hold up the market when it wants to fall.

- A belt hold is a single bar Japanese candlestick pattern that suggests a possible reversal of the prevailing trend.
- It can be bullish or bearish depending on its formation.
- It opens at or near its high and closes at or near its low, leaving very little upper or lower shadows.

<center><img src="assets/pattern202.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the Belt Hold pattern?**
Traders indeed define the belt hold differently based on their understanding. But there are two categories for this pattern – essential and optional. The essential covers the basic idea of the belt hold pattern. They should be present for all instances of the belt hold candlestick pattern.

The optional relates to enhancing the pattern. These supplements are important, but they are secondary compared to the more significant price context.

#### **Identifying a bullish Belt Hold**
##### **Essential conditions**
- The candlestick does not trade lower than its opening price
- The bar must be bullish
- The previous bar must be bearish

##### **Optional conditions**
- The candle has to close within the body of the previous candlestick
- The candlestick should close near the high
- The candlestick has to open lower than the low of the previous candlestick

#### **Identifying a bearish Belt Hold**
##### **Essential conditions**
The candlestick doesn’t trade higher than its opening price
The candlestick has to be bearish
The previous candle has to be bullish

##### **Optional conditions**
The belt hold bar must close within the body of the initial candlestick
The candlestick has to close near the low
The candlestick must open greater than the high of the previous candlestick

### **How to trade when you see the Belt Hold pattern?**
The good thing about the belt hold candlestick pattern is that the rules are simple to apply and implement, but you have to be careful to not lose your self-control, but that is always the case when day trading.

#### **Entry point**
After you’ve spotted the belt hold candlestick, open a position in the direction of the candle and go long right after the candle closes.

#### **Stop-loss**
Just as it is with any other trade, always protect your belt hold trades with a stop-loss. The stop-loss should be positioned directly under the low of the entry candle. But since the marubozu candle shows up during higher volatility, the price action will often get to the stop if placed correctly on the other side of the candle.<br>

It is therefore recommended that you place your stop-loss at one candle away from the marabozu. If you are purchasing a stock on the belt low signal, for instance, place your stop-loss beneath the low of the candle that comes after the closing marubozu candle. On the other hand, if you’re selling on a belt hold signal, your stop-loss order should be above the candle that precedes the marubozu.

#### **Take profit targets**
When you use a belt hold line trade, ensure to set a preliminary target. The first option is to end your position when the stock runs at least twice or three times the size of the marubozu pattern.<br>

The other profit taking method is to make use of the price action rules to know when to leave your trades, this if course will demand more skills and most importantly discipline.

# Key eversal Bar Pattern
Most times, traders take a ‘ready, fire, aim’ process to trade which is a backward way of trading. Trade is different from a trade trigger. A trade setup that most traders are always on the lookout for is a key reversal bar pattern combination.<br>

It forms when prices make a new extreme, yet close above or below the other two closes. The current high and low of the bar are above and below the previous high and low of the price bar.<br>

It is vital to note that this candle pattern is a setup only, and not an indication to immediately trade. For this formation to become tradable, it has to prove itself by trading above the high or low of the key reversal bar. If the high of the key reversal bar is penetrated, then the low may act as a previous protective stop for long entries. and vice versa for short entries.<br>

- The key reversal bar pattern is a 2-bar pattern.
- The first candle is typically small and the second one engulfs the first one.
- It can be bullish or bearish.

<center><img src="assets/pattern208.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the Key Reversal Bar?**
Key reversal bars can be described in many ways. Each trader has their ideas and opinions about their importance and how they should be utilized. These bars can mostly resemble an outside day, a hammer candle or a pin candle. If you’re a candlestick watcher, you will be familiar with those.<br>

Detecting the important patterns takes more than just eyeballing the formation of the bar. The ones you need to watch are the reversal bars that come up at vital highs, lows, support, resistance or after a chart pattern has been completed, or is about to play out.<br>

Key reversal bars give traders a fantastic way to get into the trend with an obvious location for a stop, and great profit potential if the trend is strong enough. This is a great risk versus reward.

### **What does the Key Reversal Bar pattern tell traders?**
A key reversal at the top of an uptrend and it tells traders when prices are making higher highs and higher lows. It is followed by another bar whose high price is higher than the high of the previous day (usually the open is also above the high of the previous day), and whose low and close is below the low of the previous day.<br>

The psychology of the pattern acts as follow. An uptrend is happening, prices open greater and make another new high, showing that buyers are in control. Yet by the end of the day prices decrease lower than the low of the previous day. Buyers were not able to keep prices at higher highs and were not able to defend keeping prices above the low of the previous day. The lower low established by the key reversal is a good warning of a potential trend change.<br>

A key reversal below a downtrend happens when prices are achieving lower highs and lower lows. Therefore, the definition of a downtrend, followed by another bar whose low price is lower than the low of the previous day, usually the open is lower than the loss of the previous day as well, and whose high and close is greater than the high of the previous day. The start of the key reversal day resembled a continuation of the downtrend, which is lower lows. Yet by the end of the trading day prices made a higher high, warning of a possible trend reversal.

### **How to trade when you see the Key Reversal Bar?**
Selecting any low or high just won’t be enough. You want to see these reversals either squeeze a new recent low or high that is rejected, or retest the support/resistance levels and fail.<br>

Swing highs are great patterns to watch for. The key reversal bars will often squeeze toward a swing high (or low) and get rejected because no volume is found. You can then proceed and trade the break of the key reversal bar, going away from the resistance or support points. For support, the same method can be used in reverse.<br>

The entry point of this strategy is on the open of the candlestick following a key reversal. The exit point is where either the stop-loss or profit target is reached. This strategy can also reverse from short to long or long to short before getting to either the profit or stop points.

#### **Long entry**
If the present bar
- makes a new bar low
- and the close of the recent bar is more than the close of the previous bar,

then enter the trade.

#### **Short entry**
If the present bar
- makes a new high
- and the close of the recent candlestick is lower than the close of the previous candlestick,

then sell the trade.

#### **Exit points**
Cover or sell with a limit order at a particular profit target. 

# Dragonfly Doji Pattern
- The dragonfly doji candlestick pattern is a 1-candle bullish pattern.
- It looks like the letter “T”.
- It prints when the candle as a long bottom shadow but (almost) no upper shadow and open and close are almost the same.

<center><img src="assets/pattern209.webp"></img></center>

### **How is the Dragonfly Doji pattern formed?**
In the open market, a Dragonfly Doji pattern is formed when the price tussle is going on between bullish and bearish traders. It is formed when the bullish traders drive prices up and bearish traders reject high prices and try to push downwards. It is also formed in an inverse situation.<br>

That means when bearish traders drive prices downwards while bullish traders push prices up.<br>

During the tussle, the market explores both, upward and downward options but it rests in a state of equilibrium.
It never commits to any direction. 

### **How to identify a Dragonfly Doji pattern?**
- Observing the candle when it opens and closes at the same price (Highly likely at the very similar level, although it is not necessary)
- Spotting a remarkably long lower wick
- Observing the absence of upper wick or close to the non-existence of upper wick

### **What does the Dragonfly Doji pattern tell traders?**
Dragonfly Doji Pattern can be regarded as a sign of neutrality or indecision because neither buyers nor sellers can gain. Although, as we have discussed earlier, the Doji pattern signals an important reversal in prices. It tells the traders that the trend of the prices may change. But this may not be exact on many occasions. The reason is, there must have been a preceding downtrend for a Dragonfly Doji to indicate a potential reversal. However, to cut long story short, the long lower shadow of the Doji indicates that for at least part of the period, sellers were in a position to take control. That naturally increases the selling pressure during the period and that is a warning sign for the traders.

### **How to trade when you see the Dragonfly Doji?**
There are several ways to trade when the traders see the Dragonfly Doji pattern. However, it is very difficult to trade a Dragonfly pattern because it is very rare on the charts. It is imperative to closely observe:

- The bullish uptrend that is a strong sign that prices may continue to the upside
- The bearish downtrend that is a possible signal of price reversal
Sideways movements when the market consolidates

# Three Outside Up & Down Pattern
- The Three Outside Up & Down candlestick patterns are 3-bar opposite reversal patterns.
- They are made of one up or down candle and then 2 candles of the opposite color.
- The second candle contains the first one.
- The third candle closes over (for the bullish formation) or below (for the bearish one) the second one.

<center><img src="assets/pattern215.webp"></img></center>

## The Three Outside Up pattern
A three outside up pattern is made up of four candlesticks that form close to support levels. The first candle is bearish, the second is a bigger bullish candle that forms a bullish engulfing, and the other two candles form higher highs. Typically, the fourth candle forms a bullish reversal pattern.<br>

This pattern is a bullish reversal pattern made up of another bullish reversal pattern known as the bullish engulfing pattern. The pattern is a two candlestick pattern. When a third candle is included, you will have a different pattern with the same meaning.

- The market is in a downtrend
- The first candle is black
- The second candle is white with a long real body and fully engulfs the first candle
- The third candle is white with a higher close than the second candle

## The Three Outside Down pattern 
The three outside down candlestick pattern occurs during a bullish market movement. It starts with a short white candlestick on day one, but the second day comes with a surprise.<br>

There is a long black candlestick pattern with a body that extends both above and below the white candlestick of the previous day, completely covering it. The third day is another bearish day with a black candlestick that closes even lower than the first day.<br> 

Because the second day starts above the first and closes far below, there are clear signs of an impending reversal. If there is any ambivalence, the low of the third day only confirms the coming downturn by adding a second black day. Clearly the sellers have managed to break the momentum of the buyers and taken the day. This is likely the very beginning of a long bearish trend.

- The market is in an uptrend
- The first candlestick is white
- The second candlestick is black with a long real body that fully contains the first candle
- The third candlestick is black with a close lower than the second candle

### **What does the Three Outside Up/Down candlestick pattern tell traders?**
#### **Three Outside Up trader psychology**
The first candle carries on the bearish trend, with the close lower than the open showing strong selling interest while raising bear confidence. The second candle starts lower but reverses, crossing through the opening tick in a display of bull power. This price action raises a red flag, informing bears to take profits or tighten stops because a reversal is possible.<br>

The security continues to post gains, increasing price above the range of the first candle, completing a bullish outside day candlestick. This raises the confidence of bulls and sets off buying signals, confirmed when the security posts a new high on the third candle.

#### **Three Outside Down trader psychology**
The first candle continues the bullish trend, with the end higher than the open showing strong buying interest while increasing the confidence of bulls. The second candle begins higher but reverses, crossing through the opening tick in a display of bear power. This price action raises a red flag, informing bulls to take profits or tighten stops because a reversal is possible.<br>

The security continues to post losses, dropping price below the range of the first candle, completing a bearish outside day candlestick. This raises bear confidence and sets off selling signals confirmed when the security has a new low on the third candle.

### **How to trade when you see the Three Outside Up/Down pattern?**
#### **Three Outside Down**
- Watch for the first smaller bullish candlestick to form
- Next, watch for the second bigger bearish candlestick to engulf first
- Then, watch for third and fourth candlesticks to form lower highs
- Traders take a short position once price breaks below the fourth candlestick
- Place stop above the fourth candle
- Some traders take a long position once price breaks above fourth candlestick 
- Then place stop below the fourth candlestick

#### **Three Outside Up**
- Watch out for first smaller bearish candlestick to form
- Next, watch for second bigger bullish candlestick to engulf first bearish one
- Then, watch for third and fourth candlesticks to form higher highs
- Traders take a long position once price breaks above the fourth candlestick
- Place stop below the fourth candle
- Some traders take a short position once price breaks below fourth candle
- Then place stop above the 4th candle

# Three-Line Strike Pattern
- The Three Line Strike candlestick pattern is a 5-bar continuation pattern.
- The bullish formation is composed of a big green candle, 3 up candles, and one down candle erasing the advance made by the prior 3 candles.
- The bearish formation is composed of a big red candle, 3 down candles, and one up candle erasing the decrease made by the prior 3 candles.

<center><img src="assets/pattern220.webp"></img></center>

## Bullish Three-Line Strike
- The first three bars are bullish and end higher
- The fourth candle is negative and ends lower than the low of the pattern


## Bearish Three-Line Strike
- The market is in a bearish
- The first three candles are bearish
- The last candle is bullish, but closes above the highest close of the previous three candles

### **How to identify the Three Line Strike candlestick pattern?**
The three-line strike is not a common pattern in forex markets. It is therefore difficult to judge its reliability, particularly on daily charts and higher. Patterns are regularly forming within each other. The large patterns like triangle patterns can affect the formation and breakdown of other candlestick patterns.<br>

The medium-sized patterns can also make a continuation pattern turn into a reversal pattern. Patterns such as the three-line strike candlesticks pattern could form the handle of the cup and handle and instead of continuing, they reverse. Therefore, a three-line strike candlestick pattern forming at the apex of symmetrical triangle patterns could have various outcomes.

### **What does the Three Line Strike tell traders?**
#### **Bullish Three-Line Strike**
Since all candlesticks have unique shapes, they also represent unique price movements in the market and offer a lot of clues about the prevailing forces. Traders are very interested in knowing about the forces that moved the market, to have a better chance of correctly predicting what will happen in the future. But it’s not simple accurately understanding the reasons behind a market move.<br>

Now, while this might be the case, watching and analyzing market data still is a valuable pastime! You will inevitably get a lot of new trading ideas of which some may become the foundation for a new trading strategy.<br>

Most market participants believe in ascending prices. Due to this, the market forms the first three bullish candles.<br>

However, with the market has gone up for a long time, it’s becoming overbought. That is, it has simply gone up so much so that more people are beginning to look to sell off some of their positions in anticipation of a pullback. In other words, market sentiment is beginning to become more bearish.<br>

As the next candle opens, you will notice how buyers push the market downwards. And while the move was violent and sudden, a lot of market participants still are bullish given the rising trend. Due to this, prices continue to go higher shortly thereafter.<br>

#### **Bearish Three-Line Strike**
It means that the bears are in control and there is a strong downward movement. This movement is enhanced by the appearance of the three black candles, each one driving the price less than the candle before it. The fourth day, however, comes with a powerful surprise – the bulls have regained strength and moved the price higher and higher, resulting in white candlestick that engulfs the previous candles, erasing the progress of the bears.<br>

Even though the reversal of sentiment shown on the fourth day may show that a reversal is likely, the opposite is true. The magnitude and speed of the reversal pose a risk for those betting on a reversal. Rather, the downtrend should be expected to resume.<br>

A bullish three line strike typically indicates that the current trend will go on. But this isn’t always the case. At times, when the pattern is flighty and less dependable, it will herald a reversal of the uptrend. Due to this, you must always check for confirmation. Watch the days that follow for a signal. A white candle, a large gap up, or a higher close all point toward a continuation of the uptrend.<br>

### **How to trade when you see the Three Line Strike candlestick pattern?**
Contrary to popular belief, you cannot just act on single candlestick patterns without additional confirmation. Most candlestick patterns aren’t simply accurate enough to be traded on their own. Rather, you need to get additional filters and conditions that succeed to rule out a lot of the losing trades you would have taken otherwise.
- Observe for the first three bearish candlesticks to form
- Next, notice for the fourth large bullish candlestick to engulf 1st three bearish ones
- Then, watch for the fifth candlestick to break above fourth bullish one
- Take a long position once price breaks above the fourth candlestick
- Place stop-loss below the base of the fourth candle
- You can also take a short position once the price falls below the fourth candle
- Then place a stop above the 4th candle

# Three Inside Up & Down Pattern
A three inside up pattern is made up of four candlesticks that appear close to support levels. The first candlestick is bearish, the second is a spinning top or doji that forms a bullish harami, and the other two candlesticks form higher highs and the forth candle forms a bullish reversal pattern.<br>

These patterns consist of three candlesticks and it is bullish reversal. It also contains another bullish reversal pattern known as the bullish harami, which is a two candlestick pattern.

- The Three Inside Up candlestick pattern is a 3-bar bullish reversal pattern.
- It is made of a large red candle, a smaller up candle contained within the first one, and then another green (up) candle closing above the previous one.
- The Three Inside Down candlestick pattern is the upside down pattern. It’s a bearish reversal pattern.
- It is made of a large green candle, a smaller down candle contained within the first one, and last a red candle closing below the previous one.

<center><img src="assets/pattern228.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the Three Inside Up & Down pattern?**
- First, a downtrend should be happening. 
- Second, a tall black (or red) candle has to appear, continuing the downward movement. 
- Third, a small white (or green) candle has to form on the following day, and its body has to be contained within the body of the previous day. Either the tops or the bottoms of the bodies may be the same price. 
- Fourth and finally, another white (or green) candle must appear, closing above the close of the prior day.

### **What does the Three Inside Up/Down pattern tell traders?**
A reversal candlestick pattern signal is stronger if it occurs after a steep trend because the markets can hardly sustain a quick price movement; a correction can usually be expected.<br>

If the second candle does not get to the halfway point of the first candlestick, but the third still closes beyond the open or the low of the first candle, it may be seen as a valid three inside down pattern.<br>

Formation of this candlestick pattern speaks about the market sentiments that the bulls are trying to take over the bears. The third day formation of a bullish candle, forming a new high, offers more confirmation of bulls rally is going to continue.

### **How to trade when you see the Three Inside Up/Down pattern?**
Even though a lot of new traders would try and apply the three inside up to their market as soon as they have learned about it, this isn’t a good idea! Of all candlestick patterns out there none is worth trading in its raw form. You need to include filters that get rid of some of the false trades, and make the pattern worthwhile. You also have to ensure that you trade a market and timeframe where the pattern works well. It is recommended that you make use of back testing to know where the pattern works.<br>

The pattern doesn’t necessarily have to be traded. It can just be used as an alert that the short-term price direction may be changing.<br>

For traders that do wish to trade it, a long position can be entered close to the end of the day on the third candle, or on the following open for a bullish three inside up. A stop-loss can be set below the low of the third, second, or first candle. This depends on how much risk the trader is willing to take.<br>

For a bearish three inside down, a trader could enter a short position close to the end of the day on the third candle or at the open the next day. A stop-loss can be placed above the high of the third, second, or first candle.<br>

The patterns do not have profit targets; therefore, it is best to use another method for deciding when to take profits, if they develop. This could include using a trailing stop-loss, leaving at a particular risk/reward ratio, or making use of technical indicators or other candlestick patterns to indicate an exit.

- Watch for first bearish candlestick to form
- Next, watch for second smaller spinning top or doji candlestick to form
- Then, watch for third and fourth candlesticks to form higher highs
- Take a long position once price breaks above the fourth candlestick
- Put a stop below the fourth candle
- Some traders usually take short positions once price breaks below fourth candle
- Then place stop above the fourth candle

# Hikkake Pattern
The pattern looks like a three inside up pattern but without constraints. The pattern doesn’t need a downtrend nor does the direction of the candles matter. They are both in the three inside up candlestick patterns. It can indicate both a continuation of the trend or a reversal. The biais depends on the direction of the breakout (above or below a previous low or high).

- The Hikkake candlestick pattern is a (quite) complex 5-candles pattern.
- Depending on how it forms it can be bullish or bearish.
- It is built with an inside day, a fake out move and then a reversal-and-breakout move.

### **How to identify the Hikkake pattern?**
- The first two or bars of the pattern are of declining size. These are known as inside-day patterns or harami candlestick patterns. It doesn’t matter if this day closes lower or higher than it opened, so long as the body of the first candle completely overshadows the body of the second.
- The third candle ends below the low in the first setup or above the high in the second setup of the second candle.
- The next candles will drift below or above the third candle and may start reversing direction.
- The last candle will end above the high of the second candle.

### **What does the Hikkake pattern tell traders?**
From a conceptual basis, the hikkake pattern is made up of short-term decline in market volatility. It then shows a breakout move in price action. This move will tend to entice traders into thinking a breakout has appeared. Traders enter the market and set a stop in the opposite direction of their trade.<br>

If the price pattern reverses, then the stop-loss order of the traders kicks in. It may give a boost to the price as it reverses past the boundary of the second bar in the formation. It’s where the stop orders will likely be found.<br>

An inside bar is a price bar that is totally within the range of the previous price bar. Inside bars are typical on price charts of a lot of timeframes.<br>

### **How to trade when you see the Hikkake pattern?**
#### **Rules for long setups**
- An inside bar 
- The next bar has a lower high and a lower low (the breakout bar showing a bearish breakout of the inside bar)
- Place a stop-buy order at the high of the inside candlestick
- Cancel the order if it does not triggered after three bars

#### **Rules for short setups**
- An inside bar is formed
- The next bar has a higher high and a higher low (the breakout bar showing a bullish breakout of the inside bar)
- Put a sell-stop at the low of the inside candlestick
- Cancel the order if it does not trigger after three bars

# Falling & Rising Three Methods Pattern
- The Rising Three Methods is a 5-candles bullish continuation candlestick pattern.
- It has a big green candle, 3 small red ones, and a big green one closing above the others.
- The Falling Three Methods is the opposite of the Rising Three Methods and is a bearish continuation candlestick pattern.

<center><img src="assets/pattern236.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the Falling Three Methods & Rising Three Methods?**
#### **The Falling Three Methods**
The falling three methods is the opposite of the rising three methods and can be seen in a downtrend. The first bar in this pattern is dark bearish with a big real body. The next few candles are expected to be smaller rising candles that are bullish and light in color. These bars should not go beyond the high or the low of the first bar. The last candlestick that completes the pattern should be lower than the close of its preceding candlestick and should close below that the close of the first candlestick.<br>

That chart pattern experiences price drop, recovers during the corrective phase, and then the drop resumes. The candlestick behaves in theory as it does in real life. It is a bearish continuation 71 percent of the time and a reversal the rest of the time. Unfortunately, with just 64 samples appearing out of 4.7 million candle lines studied, quality performance statistics are as rare as the candle itself.

#### **The Rising Three Methods**
Rising three methods is a bullish continuation pattern that is formed in an uptrend and whose conclusion sees a resumption of that trend. This is opposite to a falling three method.

### **What does the Falling Three Methods & Rising Three Methods tell traders?**
#### **Falling Three Methods**
As seen from a downtrend and the long black candle at the start of the signal, the bears are dominating the bulls. But after that, the price pauses for a moment and forms the three, short candles in the center, within the range of the first candle. The bulls aren’t able to push the price above the height of that first long candle, and they are passed by the bears. In the end, the price goes downward again, making another long black candle that closes lower than the first candle.<br>

Each candlestick pattern tells traders something about the market, how it behaved, and maybe why it behaved as it did. And while it might be difficult or impossible to determine the exact reasons why the market moved as it did, analyzing candlestick patterns in an attempt to understand their meanings is a great exercise that will help you understand the market.
#### **Rising Three Methods**
When this occurs, it means that the bulls are dominating the bears. This is obvious from the presence of the first long candle which is green in color. But they stutter a bit after that. The price stops and three or more small candles form within the range of the first candle. The bears are pushing for a comeback, but are unable to force the price lower than the first candle. In the end, the bulls overcome them once more, who push the price upward and form another long green candle. We can conclude from this that the bulls are still in control, and the uptrend will go on.

### **How to trade when you see the Falling Three Methods & Rising Three Methods?**
#### **Trading the Falling Three Methods**
Most traders who use candlestick patterns such as the falling three methods in their analysis don’t use the pattern as is. They apply various kinds of filters and conditions to create something that’s tradable according to their criteria.<br>

The falling three pattern only triggers when the three inner bars fail to break above the first one. Traders have to make a judgment as to whether that will continue. Useful points to look for when trading the falling three are:

- Appearance within a downwards trend
- Low and reducing volatility within the inner candlesticks
- Downside break of triangle support line on the last candlestick

#### **Trading the Rising Three Methods
##### **Entry point**
Traders can enter the market when the last bar in the pattern closes. Alternatively, a trade could be taken when price goes above the high of the final candle. Enthusiastic traders may look for an entry before the last bar closes but have to be prepared to leave if the fifth bar fails to complete the pattern. 

##### **Take profit**
Traders should ensure that the rising three methods pattern is not found at the bottom of important resistance to make sure that the uptrend has enough room to carry on. For example, a trend line or widely used moving average slightly above the pattern could prevent further gains. Resistance levels should be checked on longer-term charts to increase the probability of a successful trade. The rising three methods may be more efficient if the wick of the previous bullish candlestick, showing the high and low traded price for that period, are shallow and if it forms above a whole number.

##### **Risk management**
Excited traders could place a stop-loss order below the low of the last bar in the pattern or under the second small candlestick, depending on their risk tolerance. Traders who want to give their trade some room to move might put a stop-loss order below the first bullish candle or under a recent swing low.

# Engulfing Pattern
- An engulfing pattern is a 2-bar reversal candlestick pattern
- The first candle is contained with the 2nd candle
- A bullish engulfing pattern has a red candle engulfed within a green candle
- A bearish engulfing pattern has a green candle engulfed within a red candle

<center><img src="assets/pattern244.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the Engulfing candlestick pattern?**
For a perfect engulfing candlestick, no part of the first candle can exceed the shadow (or wick) of the second candle. This entails that the low and high of the second candle entirely covers the first. But the major emphasis is on the body of the candle.<br>

Engulfing candles are one of the most used candlesticks to determine if the market is experiencing downward or upward pressure. However, it is necessary to have it in mind that engulfing candles are lagging technical indicators – meaning they come up after price action – as they need the data of the worth of the two previous candlesticks before they give a signal.

### **What does Engulfing patterns tell traders?**
#### **Bullish pattern**
The bullish candlestick tells traders that buyers are in total control of the market, following a previous bearish run. It is often seen as a signal to buy and take advantage of the market reversal. The bullish pattern is also a sign for traders having a short position to think about closing that trade.<br>

Even though the wicks of engulfing candles are not as necessary as the bodies, the second candle in a bullish engulfing can give a perfect indication of the location to place a stop-loss for a long position. This is because it shows the lowest price a trader is willing to accept in exchange for an asset at that point. Therefore, if the present uptrend reverses, you will see a clear exit point for your position.

#### **Bearish pattern**
A bearish pattern indicates that the market will soon enter a downtrend, following a past increase in prices. The pattern signals that the market has been taken over by bears and could push the prices even further down. It is often seen as a sign to enter a short position in the market.<br>

Also, the pattern shows that those in a long position should consider closing their trade.<br>

Although the wicks are not usually considered important to the pattern, they can give traders an idea of where to put a stop-loss. For a bearish engulfing pattern, you should place a stop-loss above the wick of the red candle. Since this is the highest price the buyers were willing to pay before the downturn of the asset.

### **How to trade when you see the Engulfing candlestick pattern?**
#### **Isolate the trend**
The first step in trading the engulfing candle is to note the direction of the strongest trend. It’s the direction you will trade-in.<br>

An uptrend is indicated by higher-swinging highs and higher-swinging lows in price. You should take only long positions during an uptrend, buying to sell later when the price rises.<br>

A downtrend is indicated by lower-swinging lows and lower-swinging highs in price. Take only short positions when there’s a downtrend, selling a borrowed asset to buy and return it later when the price goes down.<br>

#### **Watch for upward or downward pullback**
After you’ve established the trend, wait for a pullback. If you don’t notice any trend, or if the trend is not clear, don’t use this strategy.

#### **Entering the trade after the engulfing candlestick pattern**
When you’ve isolated the trend and notice a pullback occurring, enter the trade. After initiating the trade by making use of the engulfing candle strategy, put a stop-loss above the current high for short positions, and lower than the current low for long positions.

#### **Exiting the trade**
A rule of thumb is to ensure your winners are as big as your losers; two times bigger is best. Measure the distance between your entry point and where you placed the stop loss.<br>

Exit the trade if the trend tries to reverse by making a higher high and higher low during a downtrend and short trade or by making a lower high and lower low during an uptrend and long trade.

# Morning Start Pattern
- A morning star pattern is a bullish 3-bar reversal candlestick pattern
- It starts with a tall red candle, then a small candle and finishes with a tall green candle
- The middle candle reports indecision in the market
- The opposite pattern is the evening star pattern

<center><img src="assets/pattern249.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify the Morning Star candlestick pattern?**
- Establish an existing downtrend: The market has to be showing lower highs and lower lows.
- Large bearish candle: The big bearish candle appears because of a large selling pressure and a continuation of the existing downtrend. When this happens, traders should only be looking for short trades because there is no real evidence of a reversal yet.
- Small bullish/bearish candle: Usually, the second candle is small and it presents the first sign of a tired downtrend. Often, this candle gaps lower as it makes a lower low. It doesn’t matter if the candle is bullish or bearish as the important thing is that the market is still undecided.
- Large bullish candle: This reveals the first true sign of a new buying pressure. In markets that are not forex based, the candle gaps up from the close of the previous candle and shows the start of a new uptrend.
- Subsequent price action: After a reversal has been successfully attained, traders will notice higher highs and higher lows, but should have well-placed stops to manage the risk of a failed move.

### **What does the Morning Star pattern tell traders?**
A morning star candlestick is a visual pattern, so it doesn’t need any specific calculations. The pattern forms after three sessions or it does not. But other technical indicators can assist in predicting if an interesting morning star is forming. Some interesting signal confluence can be whether the price action is close to a support zone or if the relative strength indicator (RSI) is showing that the commodity or stock is oversold.

### **How to trade when you see the Morning Star pattern?**
- Confirm the downtrend on the trading timeframe: It is very important to confirm because if there is no downtrend, there will be no point in trading the morning star pattern. You can confirm it on a higher timeframe or on your trading timeframe.
- Find out the morning star pattern on your trading timeframe: If the first red candle is with low volume, and the second one is a small red candle, there will be no indication to go long yet. If the next is a long green candle with high volume, then this will be a strong indication of a trend reversal.
- Entry, take profit and stop loss: Enter the trade when the next green candle closes and close the position at any resistance area or supply-demand zone. Also, you can close your position when the price goes near the significant resistance level of the higher timeframe.

# Evening Start Pattern
- An evening star pattern is a bearish 3-bar reversal candlestick pattern
- It starts with a tall green candle, then a small candle and finishes with a tall red candle
- The middle candle reports indecision in the market
- The opposite pattern is the morning star pattern

<center><img src="assets/pattern253.webp"></img></center>

### **How to identify an Evening Star?**
- Establish an existing uptrend: The market should show higher highs and higher lows.
- Large bullish candle: The big bullish candle is the end product of big buying pressure and a continuation of the existing uptrend. At this point, traders should only look for long trades because there is no evidence of a reversal yet.
- Small bearish or bullish candle: The second candle is a small candle, at times called the Doji candle that presents the first sign of an uptrend that is tired. Most times, the gap of this candle is higher as it makes a higher high. It doesn’t matter if the candle is bullish or bearish as the important thing here is that the market is undecided.
- Large bearish candle: The first sign of new selling pressure is shown in this candle. In markets that are non-forex, this candle gaps down from the close of the previous candle and signals the beginning of a new downtrend.
- Subsequent price action: After the reversal is successful, traders will notice lower highs and lower lows but should always manage the risk of a failed move through the use of well-positioned stops.

### **What does Evening Star tell traders?**
Usually, a candlestick pattern is a way of presenting some information about a stock in a condensed manner. Particularly, it presents the open, high, low and close price for the stock over a given period of time.<br>

Every candlestick consists of a candle and two wicks. The length of the candle is a function of the range between the highest and lowest price during the trading period. A long candle shows a big change in price, while a short one shows a small price change. In other words, the bodies of longer candlesticks show an intense buying or selling pressure, depending on the direction of the trend. Similarly, short candlesticks show little price movement.<br>

The evening star pattern is considered a very strong indicator of future price declines. The pattern forms over a period of three days, with the first day consisting of a big white candle showing a continued rise in prices, the second day consisting of a candle that is smaller that indicates a more modest price increase, while the third day indicates a large red candle that opens at a price lower than the previous day and closes close to the middle of the first day.<br>

Most traders consider the evening star as a reliable indicator that a downward trend is starting. However, it can be hard to discern when there is noise of stock price data. To help determine its reliability, traders mostly make use of price oscillators and trend lines to see if the patter has occurred.

### **How to trade when you see an Evening Star candlestick pattern?**
- Set the right graph time frame: This will depend on a lot of trading strategy and it will give you a bigger picture of the price action.
- Get to know the open, high, low and close prices: Looking at a chart with 1-day candle will give you this idea. You will see the daily open and close prices and the high and low prices.
- Wait for the daily RSI to cross over 70: Most traders view an RSI cross above 70 as a clear overbought signal. It is a common method used by forex traders.
- Downgrade the time frame: After you’ve identified the RSI above 70 (overbought condition) on the longer term chart, it is time to zoom in.
