# Patterns
Patterns are the distinctive formations created by the movements of security prices on a chart. A pattern is identified by a line that connects common price points, such as closing prices or highs or lows, during a specific period of time. Chartists seek to identify patterns as a way to anticipate the future direction of a securityâ€™s price. Patterns are the foundation of technical analysis.

- Trading patterns can deal with historical price patterns of an asset. Examples for stocks would include: past stock prices, moving averages, and post earnings stock movements.
- Other types of patterns to consider can deal with macro data points. Examples would include how the overall market's price behavior is acting, whether or not a group is breaking out or down, and other historical tendencies a trader notices.
