# Autoregressive Moving Average
The Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) method models the next step in the sequence as a linear function of the observations and residual errors at prior time steps.<br>

It combines both Autoregression (AR) and Moving Average (MA) models.<br>

The notation for the model involves specifying the order for the AR(p) and MA(q) models as parameters to an ARMA function, e.g. ARMA(p, q). An ARIMA model can be used to develop AR or MA models.<br>
