# Vector Autoregression
The Vector Autoregression (VAR) method models the next step in each time series using an AR model. It is the generalization of AR to multiple parallel time series, e.g. multivariate time series.<br>

The notation for the model involves specifying the order for the AR(p) model as parameters to a VAR function, e.g. VAR(p).<br>

The method is suitable for multivariate time series without trend and seasonal components.<br>
