# Vector Autoregression Moving-Average
The Vector Autoregression Moving-Average (VARMA) method models the next step in each time series using an ARMA model. It is the generalization of ARMA to multiple parallel time series, e.g. multivariate time series.<br>

The notation for the model involves specifying the order for the AR(p) and MA(q) models as parameters to a VARMA function, e.g. VARMA(p, q). A VARMA model can also be used to develop VAR or VMA models.<br>

The method is suitable for multivariate time series without trend and seasonal components.
