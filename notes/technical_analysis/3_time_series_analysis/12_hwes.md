# Holt Winter's Exponential Smoothing 
The Holt Winterâ€™s Exponential Smoothing (HWES) also called the Triple Exponential Smoothing method models the next time step as an exponentially weighted linear function of observations at prior time steps, taking trends and seasonality into account.<br>

The method is suitable for univariate time series with trend and/or seasonal components
